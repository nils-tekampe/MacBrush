{"name":"Macbrush","tagline":"","body":"### MacBrush\r\nThis command line tool cleans a directory and all its subdirectories from a set of hidden files that OS X creates and enters an observation mode afterwards. Within the observation mode, each hidden file that is created by OS X is directly deleted after it has been create by the OS. The programm is of specific use for folders which are shared between OS X and other Operating Systems (e.g. via Dropbox).\r\n\r\nThe tool provides more or less the same functionality as some commercial tools (e.g. BlueHarvest) but works heedlessly (i.e. without a graphical user interface).\r\n\r\n**The tool is currently in alpha stage. There is quite some work to be done. So use it with care!**\r\n\r\n**It should be noted that OSX usually creates the temporary files that are removed by the program for a certain reason. Please only use this program if you know what you are doing and if you are sure that no important information will get lost.**\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\nInstallation is pretty simple and straightforward. Clone this repository or download as an archive. Then copy the file McBrush from the folder /binary to /usr/local/bin on your Mac; afterwards you need to set the execute permission on that file.
