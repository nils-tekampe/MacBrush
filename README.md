# McBrush
This programm cleans a directory and all its subdirectories from a set of hidden files that OS X creates and enters an observation mode afterwards. Within the observation mode, each hidden file that is created by OS X is directly deleted after it has been create by the OS.
The programm is of specific use for folders which are shared between OS X and other Operating Systems (e.g. via Dropbox).

#Installation

Then copy the file McBrush from the folder /binary to /usr/local/bin on your Mac; afterwards you need to set the execute permission on that file.
