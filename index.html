<p>This command line tool cleans a directory and all its subdirectories from a set of hidden files that OS X creates and enters an observation mode afterwards. Within the observation mode, each hidden file that is created by OS X is directly deleted after it has been create by the OS. The programm is of specific use for folders which are shared between OS X and other Operating Systems (e.g. via Dropbox).</p>

<p>The tool provides more or less the same functionality as some commercial tools (e.g. BlueHarvest) but works heedlessly (i.e. without a graphical user interface).</p>

<p><strong>The tool is currently in alpha stage. There is quite some work to be done. So use it with care!</strong></p>

<a id="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h2>

<p>Installation is pretty simple and straightforward. Clone this repository or download as an archive. Then copy the file McBrush from the folder /binary to /usr/local/bin on your Mac; afterwards you need to set the execute permission on that file. As an alternative you can use the simple install.sh in the binary folder. As an alternative you can use the following set of commands for installation:</p>

<pre><code>$ wget https://github.com/nils-tekampe/MacBrush/blob/master/binary/MacBrush
$ cp ./MacBrush /usr/local/bin
$ chmod +x /usr/local/bin/MacBrush
</code></pre>

<p>A brew formular is under development and will be added soon. </p>
